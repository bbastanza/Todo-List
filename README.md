## Summary

I made this app to further my knowledge of JS, HTML and CSS.

Building this app I learned about a lot about DOM manipulation, using local storage, how to impliment buttons in clear way and how to take inputs from users and impliment them into the HTML.

The biggest roadblock I encountered at the time was how to keep class changes in local storage. It was a welcomed challenge and finishing it the way I wanted to was very rewarding.
